conservative behaviour as well.</li>

</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is strange, because the results are even more conservative, whereas
more of the tree in the foreground usually results in an
anti-conservative outcome.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Single branches are not sufficiently influential to cause
anti-conservative behaviour
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We see anti-conservative behaviour with information sparseness</li>
</ul></li>
<li>With more of the tree in the foreground, we see similar behaviour to M2a</li>
<li>If we restrict to simulations with \(\omega_2>1\), we often match \(\chi^2_1\)</li>
<li>With one foreground branch, the models are so conservative, a
re-calibration may be called for</li>
<li>The LR statistics distributions looks very different depending on how the
foreground is chosen.  This is a problem.</li>
<li>Penalization could still be relevant when the foreground takes up more of
the tree.</li>
<li>When \(p_0+p_1<1\), the theory of Self and Liang applies and the LRS
distributions should match a χ² mixture.  Perhaps running simulation 9
with penalization to support this.</li>
<li>When \(p_0+p_1=1\), the theory of Self and Liang does not apply (why) and we
expect conservative behaviour.</li>
<li>\(p_0+p_1=1\) is the better \(H_0\) due to adaptive evolution (from a MutSel
perspective).  This can occur when going from \(\omega<1\) to&#x2026;??.  That's
exactly what \(p_{2a}\) corresponds to.</li>
<li>Inflated \(\omega_2\) is still a problem.</li>
<li>Corrections for multiple tests assume that the probability of a type I
error is the same for each test, but that's not the case here.</li>
