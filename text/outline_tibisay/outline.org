#+TITLE: Branch-Site Study with Cephalopod Data

* Branch-Site Simulations
** Simulations under $H_0$
   - All simulations except 1. use an 8-taxon tree
   - Simulations 1-4 used 500-codon sequences, simulations 5-11 used 5000-codon sequences, and simulation 16 used 10000-codon sequences
   - All Simulations were with 1000 replicates

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/bsa_sim1_4-taxon-tree.pdf][1.]] One foreground branch at a tip of symmetric 4-taxon tree; total tree
     length 3; $p_0=0.75$, $p_1=0.21$, $\omega_0=0.4$
     - Conservative behaviour unless we condition on $\omega_2>1$, in which case
       we match a $\chi^2_1$
     - Distribution of MLEs look good except some inflated $\omega_2$ estimates

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/bsa_sim2_8-taxon-tree.pdf][2.]] One foreground branch at a tip; total tree length 3; $p_0=0.7$,
     $p_1=0.2$, $\omega_0=0.3$
     - Conservative behaviour unless we condition on $\omega_2>1$, in which case
       we match a $\chi^2_1$
     - Distribution of MLEs look good except some inflated $\omega_2$ estimates

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/bsa_sim3_8-taxon-tree.pdf][3.]] One foreground branch at a tip; total tree length 3; $p_0=0.75$,
     $p_1=0.25$, $\omega_0=0.3$
     - Clear conservative behaviour unless we condition on $\omega_2>1$, in which
       case we match a $\chi^2_1$
     - Distribution of MLEs look good except some inflated $\omega_2$ estimates

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/bsa_sim4_8-taxon-tree.pdf][4.]] One foreground branch at a tip; total tree length 3; $p_0=0.25$,
     $p_1=0.75$, $\omega_0=0.3$
     - Slight conservative behaviour unless we condition on $\omega_2>1$, in
       which case we nearly match a $\chi^2_1$ (slightly anti-conservative
       relative to $\chi^2_1$ distribution)
     - Distribution of MLEs look good except some inflated $\omega_2$ estimates

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/bsa_sim5_8-taxon-tree.pdf][5.]] One foreground branch at a tip; foreground branch is 1/10 the length of
     the other branches; total tree length 6; $p_0=0.5$, $p_1=0.5$, $\omega_0=0$
     - Very conservative behaviour, even when we condition on $\omega_2>1$ (386
       of the $\omega_2$ estimates).
     - There are left tails on the $p_0$ and $p_1$ MLE distributions and right
       tails on the p₂ₐ and p₂b and $\omega_2$ MLEs.

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/bsa_sim6_8-taxon-tree.pdf][6.]] One foreground branch at a tip; foreground branch 10x the length of the
     other branches; total tree length 6; $p_0=0.5$, $p_1=0.5$, $\omega_0=0$
     - Still very conservative behaviour, even when we condition on $\omega_2>1$
       (924 of the $\omega_2$ estimates).
     - Distribution of MLEs look good except some inflated $\omega_2$ estimates

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/bsa_sim7_8-taxon-tree.pdf][7.]] Half of tree in foreground; total tree length 6; $p_0=0.5$, $p_1=0.5$,
     $\omega_0=0$
     - Anti-conservative behaviour; conditioning on $\omega_2>1$ (674) shows
       slight anti-conservative behaviour relative to $\chi^2_1$
     - MLEs look good (boundary issues); some inflated $\omega_2$ estimates

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/bsa_sim8_8-taxon-tree.pdf][8.]] Half of tree in foreground; total tree length 6; $p_0=0.475$,
     $p_1=0.475$, $\omega_0=0$
     - Anti-conservative behaviour; conditioning on $\omega_2>1$ (553) shows
       anti-conservative behaviour relative to $\chi^2_1$
     - MLEs look good (boundary issues only with ωₒ); no inflated $\omega_2$
       estimates

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/bsa_sim9_8-taxon-tree.pdf][9.]] Half of tree in foreground; total tree length 6; $p_0=0.375$,
     $p_1=0.375$, $\omega_0=0$
     - Anti-conservative behaviour; conditioning on $\omega_2>1$ (531) shows
       anti-conservative behaviour relative to $\chi^2_1$
     - MLEs look good (boundary issues only with ωₒ); no inflated $\omega_2$
       estimates

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/zbsa_sim10_8-taxon-tree.pdf][10.]] One internal branch in foreground 1/10th the length; total tree length
     6; $p_0=0.5$, $p_1=0.5$, $\omega_0=0$
     - Very conservative behaviour; conditioning on $\omega_2>1$ (571) shows very
       conservative behaviour as well.
     - MLEs are wide ($p_0/p_1$ long left tails, $p_{2a}/p_{2b}$ long right
       tails); $\omega_2$ has inflated estimates

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/zbsa_sim11_8-taxon-tree.pdf][11.]] One internal branch in foreground 10x the length; total tree length 6;
     $p_0=0.5$, $p_1=0.5$, $\omega_0=0$
     - Still conservative behaviour, but less so with the longer branch;
       conditioning on $\omega_2>1$ (421) shows only very mild conservative
       behaviour relative to $\chi^2_1$ mixture.
     - Weight MLEs are bimodal; $\omega_2$ has inflated estimates

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/zbsa_sim13_8-taxon-tree.pdf][13.]] Simulation under M3 k=3 with [p0,p1,p2] = [0.4,0.4,0.2] and [w0,w1,w2]
         = [0.1,0.5,0.9].  Symmetric 8-taxon tree with one foreground branch.
     - Very conservative.  $\omega_2$ has most weight near 1 and some inflated
       values.

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/zbsa_sim14_8-taxon-tree.pdf][14.]] Same as simulation 13. but with half of the tree in the foreground.
     - This is strange, because the results are even more conservative, whereas
       more of the tree in the foreground usually results in an
       anti-conservative outcome.

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/zbsa_sim15_8-taxon-tree.pdf][15.]] Simulation under M3 k=3 with [p0,p1,p2] = [0.4,0.2,0.4] and [w0,w1,w2]
     = [0.1,0.5,1.0] and half of the tree in the foreground
     - Less conservative than 14., but still conservative, despite half of the
       tree in the foreground.

     [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/zbsa_sim16_8-taxon-tree.pdf][16.]] Simulation under the null with [p0,p1] = [0.5,0.5] and
         [$\omega_0$,$\omega_1$] = [0,1] and 10,000 sites, 8 taxa, and half of
         the tree in the foreground.

*** Notes
    - Single branches are not sufficiently influential to cause
      anti-conservative behaviour
      - We see anti-conservative behaviour with information sparseness
    - With more of the tree in the foreground, we see similar behaviour to M2a
    - If we restrict to simulations with $\omega_2>1$, we often match $\chi^2_1$
    - With one foreground branch, the models are so conservative, a
      re-calibration may be called for
    - The LR statistics distributions looks very different depending on how the
      foreground is chosen.  This is a problem.
    - Penalization could still be relevant when the foreground takes up more of
      the tree.
    - When $p_0+p_1<1$, the theory of Self and Liang applies and the LRS
      distributions should match a χ² mixture.  Perhaps running simulation 9
      with penalization to support this.
    - When $p_0+p_1=1$, the theory of Self and Liang does not apply (why) and we
      expect conservative behaviour.
    - $p_0+p_1=1$ is the better $H_0$ due to adaptive evolution (from a MutSel
      perspective).  This can occur when going from $\omega<1$ to...??.  That's
      exactly what $p_{2a}$ corresponds to.
    - Inflated $\omega_2$ is still a problem.
    - Corrections for multiple tests assume that the probability of a type I
      error is the same for each test, but that's not the case here.

* Data
      - [[gnus:Dal#CANiYCztS-ihazv3UnjOxOANHK35NT4Lf0OKL2_gkaq5mdMHBiA@mail.gmail.com][Email from Tibisay Escalona about Cephalopad Data]]
      - [[file:~/scm/tibisay_cephalopods/data/Data_28May_2019_TE/][Cephalopod Data]]

        There are 35 taxa with 3738 codons (3539 without ambiguous sites).  Each of
        the 10 branch-site tests is on a single branch.

* Branch-Site Analyses

  [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/ceph.pdf][Summary of Branch-Site Analyses of Celphalopod Data]]

  The LR tests for #2, 4, 5, 6, and 8 (Groenlandibelus, Loliginidae,
  Oegop_Bathy, and Oegopsida, Sepiida) were significant after correcting for
  multiple tests.

* SBA Analyses

  [[https://ftfl.ca/misc/bsa/cephalopod_sba_summary.pdf][Summary of SBA Analyses of Cephalopod Data]]

  The SBA analyses were run on the 5 branches that were significant under the
  branch-site tests.  The $\omega_2$ estimates tended towards infinity (they
  were all 999 for Groenlandibelus and Sepiida).  The other MLE estimates
  looked stable, except for some instability with OegopBathy and Oegopsida
  branches.

* Proposed Simulations

  Simulate 35 taxa 3500 codons using tree topology and foreground branches from
  Cephalopod data both under the null and with various ω>1.  We could also run
  these under SBA to discover MLE distributions.

    - test for double/triple (DT) nucleotide changes
    - test for recombination
    - test for variation in dS
    - rerun the tests for Muse and Gaut (option 5 in codeml), which models
      transition probabilities in the Q matrix as a proportion to the target
      nucleotide
